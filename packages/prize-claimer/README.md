PoolTogether hyperstructure (v5) OpenZeppelin Defender autotask to claim prizes on behalf of depositors.

## üìñ Tutorial

### [Creating a PoolTogether Prize Claiming bot](https://mirror.xyz/chuckbergeron-g9.eth/xPSEh1pfjV2IT1yswcsjN2gBBrVf548V8q9W23xxA8U)

This package is both a CLI for setting the config parameters of the OpenZeppelin job and a build task for compiling the `handler()` prior to deploy on OZ Defender.

The bulk of determining if a claim is profitable is in the **[/packages/library/src/claimerProfitablePrizeTxs.ts#L58](../library)**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Setup

To run the OpenZeppelin Defender autotask locally or build for OpenZeppelin Defender, first set up your environment variables using `dotenv`:

#### ENV

Copy `.envrc.example` and input the env variables needed to run this project.

```sh
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

Once your env variables are setup, load them with:

```sh
direnv allow
```

#### LIST OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

```sh
CHAIN_ID: The chain ID of which network to run the autotask on
JSON_RPC_URI: Your Infura/Alchemy/etc JSON RPC URI
COVALENT_API_KEY: (Optional) Your Covalent API key for getting USD values of tokens
USE_FLASHBOTS: boolean, if you would like to keep transactions private from the mempool on chains that support flashbots
MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD_USD: the minimum (in USD) you want to profit from each swap (ie. 1 is $1.00)

### THIS:

CUSTOM_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY: run liquidations using your own EOA

DEFENDER_TEAM_API_KEY: OZ Defender Team API Key
DEFENDER_TEAM_API_SECRET: OZ Defender Team Secret Key

```

### 2. Start checking draw auctions

When everything is set and the env vars have been exported you can run the bot locally:

```sh
yarn start
```

### 3. Update remote autotask

With the config in place from step 1, you can build and update the autotask on OpenZeppelin Defender using:

```sh
yarn update
```
